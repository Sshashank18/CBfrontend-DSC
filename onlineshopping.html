            Review:
            I did Crux - Java fundamentals course with Rishab sir. It was a great experience.
            The brain teasers and assignments, actually the whole lot of content was really 
            good. Some problems were challenging yet interesting. Was explained very well 
            where ever I struck...

            Review:
            When i was watching “Dear Zindagi”, i could relate Sharukh Khan to Arnav Bhaiya.
            The way Sharukh Khan was giving life lessons to Aliya Bhatt, in the same way 
            Arnav Bhaiya will give coding life lessons which will guide you throughout your
            code life...

            Review:
            Coding Blocks was an amazing experience for me. I belong to the electronics 
            department and had a little experience in coding but I think it has helped me 
            think things through in a much more analytical manner. Coding is important no 
            matter which branch you are in. It gives you a better understanding

            Review:
            This was my first complete course at coding blocks. I attended the machine 
            learning bootcamp in Winter 2016 and loved it which made me join the full 
            course. Shubham bhaiya and Ayush bhaiya(TA) have good knowledge about the 
            field and were very helpful in making us understand the concepts.
